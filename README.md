# What is this
This is a tool box full of code snippets (mainly python) for perosnal use in my daily life.

## pdf
During my reading journey with tons of resources online, I found that using third-party binaries and apps too heavy. So I opt in coming up some quick py scripts to save my time.

### Add Page Number
My printer doesn't support adding page number for some PDFs I found/converted myself, so this is for adding this for better printing.
Note that this will have the size original input file increased in bulk in the final output. (my exp told me that for a 400page~6MB PDF it's turned into ~25MB). I didn't bother to tinkering this in proficiency regard as I have to print it out anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
